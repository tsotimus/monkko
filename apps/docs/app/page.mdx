# Monkko

**The Modern MongoDB ORM for TypeScript**

Our aim is simple: provide the **best modern developer experience possible** for MongoDB. Stop fighting your ORM. Get full type safety, automatic code generation, and built-in validation—without sacrificing performance.

## Why Monkko?

Traditional MongoDB ORMs force you to choose between developer experience and performance. **Monkko gives you both.**

### TypeScript First

Built from the ground up with TypeScript. Every query, every populate, every field—fully typed.

### Auto-Generated Code

Define schemas once. Our CLI generates TypeScript types and Zod schemas automatically.

### Built-in Validation

Zod validation out of the box. ValiBot and more coming soon. Catch errors before they hit your database.

### Multi-Database Ready

Purpose-built for MongoDB clusters. Connect to multiple databases effortlessly.

## What's Coming Next

Monkko is actively developed with exciting features on the roadmap:

### Aggregation Pipeline Support

Fully typed aggregation pipelines with auto-completion for every stage

### Migration Tooling

Safe database migrations with version control and rollback support

### More Validation Libraries

ValiBot, Yup, and custom validator support coming soon
