# Guide

Welcome to the comprehensive Monko guide. This section covers everything you need to know to use Monko effectively in your projects.

## Core Concepts

### Schema-First Development
Monko follows a schema-first approach where you define your data models using `.monko.ts` files, then generate TypeScript types and runtime validation automatically.

### Type Safety
Every operation in Monko is fully typed, from schema definition to query results. This eliminates runtime errors and provides excellent IDE support.

### Performance
The Go-powered CLI ensures fast type generation, while the runtime ORM is optimized for MongoDB operations.

## Topics

### [Field Types](/guide/field-types)
Learn about all available field types including strings, numbers, dates, references, and arrays with their validation options.

### [Relationships](/guide/relationships)  
Set up relations between documents with type-safe populate functionality.

### [Validation](/guide/validation)
Add custom validation rules and leverage Zod integration for runtime safety.

### [Queries](/guide/queries)
Master the query API with MongoDB-style syntax and full TypeScript support.

### [CLI Commands](/guide/cli)
Complete reference for all CLI commands and configuration options.

### [Migrations](/guide/migrations)
Handle schema changes and data migrations safely in production.

### [Multiple Databases](/guide/multiple-databases)
Work with multiple MongoDB databases and collections in a single application.

### [Testing](/guide/testing)
Best practices for testing applications built with Monko.

### [Troubleshooting](/guide/troubleshooting)
Common issues and their solutions.

## Best Practices

- Keep schemas focused and avoid deeply nested objects
- Use references instead of embedding for large related data
- Leverage TypeScript strict mode for maximum safety
- Set up proper indexing in MongoDB for referenced fields
- Use the CLI's `--watch` mode during development
